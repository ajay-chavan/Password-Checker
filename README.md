# Password-Checker
This python script is helpful in checking your password if it has been compromised anywhere. This script uses the Have I been pwned api to check the password in their database. It uses the SHA1 secure algorithm to convert the entered password in SHA1 encrypted hash code to check if it matches in API database.
